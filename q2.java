//2-Using an array list of Integer type accept some values from the user (as long as he wants to input),
//and then insert them, one by one, into the arraylist. Each time the user inputs a number,
//your code must find out the appropriate location for that value and insert it accordingly. Like this,
//when the user stops inputting more values, code would show the list of all inputted numbers, sorted in
//ascending order.
